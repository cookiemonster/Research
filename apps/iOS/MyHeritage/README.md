#### Security

The application does not check if the certificate in question is a specific certificate from MyHermitage.
Because of the lack of certificate pinning creates a security hole. The deviceâ€™s trust store can easily be compromised by using certificates, and allowing a man-in-the-middle attack on the device itself. This can be easiliy remediated with 
certificate pinning by including the certificate known to be used by the server in the app. Most decent banking apps and 
the AAA-Style games phones and tablets have these.
